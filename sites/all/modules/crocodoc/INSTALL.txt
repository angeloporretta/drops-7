Crocodoc is an extension to the core field module, which must be enabled.

1. Unpack the crocodoc folder and contents in the appropriate modules
   directory of your Drupal installation.  This is probably
   sites/all/modules/
2. Enable the crocodoc module in the administration tools. It appears
   in the Modules list as "Embedded Crocodoc Viewer."
